description: Getting started with the Render Layer
---

Getting started with the Render Layer is quite simple. The necessary modules and classes are all
present in the `\Approach\Render` namespace.

The easiest way to understand the Render Layer is to create a simple HTML page with the Render Layer, however,
the render layer is much more powerful, being able to render not just HTML, but also XML, JSON and basically any format 
you can think of.

So, think of a simple HTML page, with a header, a body and a footer. The header and footer are the same on every page,
but the body is different. The body is the content of the page, and it is different for every page.

So, the way you can think of the Render Layer is that it is a way to render the body of the page, and then include
the header and footer around it.
Sort of like this:
    
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My Page</h1>
        <p>This is my page</p>
    </body>
    <footer>
        <p>NoobScience 2024</p>
    </footer>
</html>
```

## Set Up

Since we will be rendering some good o'l HTML, we will need to set up a few thing first. First, we need to include the 
`\Approach\Render\HTML` namespace, which contains all the classes we need to render HTML.

```php
use Approach\Render\HTML;
```

Next, we need to create a root element, a root element is the root of the HTML document, and it is the element that
contains all the other elements. In HTML, the root element is the `<html>` tag. We can create a root element like this:

```php
$root = new HTML(tag: 'html');
```

> Tip: Include `$root->before = <!DOCTYPE html>' . PHP_EOL;` to add the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag to the beginning of the
> document.

While we're at it, let's create the `<head>` and `<body>` tags, and add them to the root element.

```php
$head = new HTML(tag: 'head');
$body = new HTML(tag: 'body');

$root[] = $head;
$root[] = $body;
```

Every HTML element can be extended by adding elements to it, called children. You can do this by extending
the element with the `[]` operator. 

## Defining some content

Now that we have some basic structure, let's add some content to the `<head>` and `<body>` tags.

First, let's add in a title, and a stylesheet.

```php
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'title', content: 'My Page');
$head[] = new HTML(
        tag: 'link', 
        attributes: ['rel' => 'stylesheet', 'href' => 'style.css'], 
        selfContained: true);
```

Now, you can `echo $head` to see what it looks like.

```html
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

> Since the `<link>` tag is self contained, it doesn't need a closing tag, so we set `selfContained` to `true`.

Now, let's add some content to the `<body>` tag.

```php
$body[] = new HTML(tag: 'h1', content: 'My Page');
$body[] = new HTML(tag: 'p', content: 'This is my page');
```

Now, you can `echo $body` to see what it looks like.

```html
<body>
    <h1>My Page</h1>
    <p>This is my page</p>
</body>
```

## Putting it all together

When you put all this good stuff together, you get something like this:

```php
// index.php

use Approach\Render\HTML;

$root = new HTML(tag: 'html');

$head = new HTML(tag: 'head');
$body = new HTML(tag: 'body');

$root[] = $head;
$root[] = $body;

$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'title', content: 'My Page');
$head[] = new HTML(
        tag: 'link', 
        attributes: ['rel' => 'stylesheet', 'href' => 'style.css'], 
        selfContained: true);

$body[] = new HTML(tag: 'h1', content: 'My Page');
$body[] = new HTML(tag: 'p', content: 'This is my page');

echo $root;
```

Now, if you visit `index.php` in your browser, you should be able to see your page.
