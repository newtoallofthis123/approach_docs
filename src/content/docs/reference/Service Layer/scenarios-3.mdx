## 1. Reading and processing data from a JSON file

These scenarios assume you have made a class "MyClass" which extends from Service. You may use the default Service in many cases by simply creating new Encoding/Decoding classes.
(See ./approach/Service/CSV.php for a simple example)

In this scenario, we will read data from a JSON file, process it, and then save the output in another JSON file.

1. Create a JSON file named "input.json" with the following content:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {"value": 1},
        {"value": 2},
        {"value": 3}
    ]
}
```

2. Create a new Service instance with the following parameters:

```php
$service = new MyService(
    flow::in,
    true,
    format::json,
    format::json,
    target::file,
    target::file,
    'input.json',
    'output.json'
);
```

3. Define the `Process` method to double the value of each item in the data array

```php
public function Process(array $payload = null): void
{
    $this->payload = $payload ?? $this->payload;
    foreach ($this->payload['data'] as &$item) {
        $item['value'] *= 2;
    }
}
```

4. Run the service. The result will be saved in a file named "output.json".

## 2. Fetching data from an API and saving it as a CSV file

In this scenario, we will fetch data from an API, process it, and then save the output as a CSV file.

1. Create a new Service instance with the following parameters:

```php
$service = new MyService(
    flow::in,
    true,
    format::json,
    format::csv,
    target::api,
    target::file,
    'https://api.example.com/data',
    'output.csv'
);
```

2. Define the `Process` method to double the value of each item in the data array

```php
public function Process(array $payload = null): void
{
    $this->payload = $payload ?? $this->payload;
    $flatData = [['ID', 'Name', 'Age']];
    foreach ($this->payload['data'] as $item) {
        $flatData[] = [$item['id'], $item['name'], $item['age']];
    }
    $this->payload = $flatData;
}
```

3. Run the service. The result will be saved in a file named "output.csv".

## 3. Receiving input from the command line and printing the output

In this scenario, we will receive input from the command line, process it, and then print the output.

1. Create a new Service instance with the following parameters:

```php
$service = new MyService(
	flow::in,
	false,
	format::text,
	format::text,
	target::cli,
	target::cli
);
```

2. Define the `Process` method to double the value of each item in the data array

```php
public function Process(array $payload = null): void
{
	$this->payload = $payload ?? $this->payload;
	$this->payload = strrev($this->payload);
}
```

3. Run the service. The user will be prompted to enter input text in the command line, and the reversed text will be printed as output.
